-> Examples of "Consonant->Vowel" linking.
-> "about_you" in "How about you?" demonstrates "t + y" turning into
   "ch". Note that not all native speakers do this.

Page 17 - Listening Plus 2 - Sound Box
-> Examples of Thought Groups. Native speakers tend to put pauses
   at logical places in sentences.

Page 27 - Listening Plus 3 - Sound Box
-> Examples of "Consonant->Consonant" linking.
-> Examples of linking where consonants link to schwa. Schwa is the most
   common vowel in English, and is written in IPA as an upsidedown 'e'.
   In the textbook they refer to this as "disappearing sounds", but really
   it's just schwa.
   See #1: "... work_in Japan." Here, 'k' is linking to 'i', where 'i'
   is in fact pronounced as schwa.

-> Examples of sentence stress. #1 and #2 show quite well how the same
   sentence can be used to answer different questions in fundamentally
   different ways.

Page 55 - Listening Plus 5 - Sound Box
-> Examples of common homophones.

Page 63 - Listening Plus 6 - Sound Box
-> Examples of compound words vs. adjective+noun pairs that look
   similar. Note that the compound versions only have one main accent.

Page 79 - Listening Plus 7 - Sound Box
-> Examples of intonation, and how various tones of voice can change
   the meaning of sentences.
